## MRI

### Normal
INDICATION
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast MRI with multi-planar T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR, T2-FFE, isotropic 3D-T1WI and diffusion weighted sequences of the brain at 1.5T
FINDINGS: 
The cerebral hemispheres, brainstem and cerebellum show normal signal with no region with restricted diffusion.
There is no intra or extra axial mass lesion or haemorrhage.
The ventricular system and sub-arachnoid spaces are normal.   
The cranium and scalp show normal signal.
IMPRESSION: Normal study.  

### Cerebral microangiopathy
BRAIN MRI
INDICATION: 
Technique: Non-contrast multiplanar T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR and T2W-FFE, DWI & ADC of the brain were acquired at 1.5T
FINDINGS: 
There is bilateral periventricular leukoaraiosis, consistent with chronic small vessel ischaemia. There is no restricted diffusion in the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem and cerebellum.
There is mild ex vacuo dilatation of the ventricles due to mild brain atrophy. 
The sub-arachnoid spaces are normal.   
The cranium and scalp show normal signal.
IMPRESSION: Fazekas grade II cerebral microangiopathy  


### Senile brain and cerebral microangiopathy
Indication: SEPSIS ?FOCUS KIV VASCULAR DEMENTIA
Technique: Axial T1WI, T2WI, FLAIR and T2W-FFE, SAGITTAL T1W-FFE & T2WI, CORONAL T1W-FFE, T2W1, AXIAL DWI & ADC, of the brain were obtained at 1.5T
Findings: 
There is prominence of the sulci, fissures, basal cisterns and ventricles, consistent with senile brain atrophy.
There is bilateral periventricular and deep white matter leukoaraiosis, consistent with chronic small vessel ischaemia.
A small round FLAIR and T2WI hyper-intense lesion, consistent with a chronic lacunar infarction, is in the left pons.
There is no shift of the midline brain structures.
The paranasal sinuses, mastoids, calvarium and scalp show normal signal.
Conclusion: Senile brain atrophy, cerebral microangiopathy and chronic pontine lacunar infarction


### MRI OF THE HEAD AND NECK
Indication: CONJUCTIVAL MASS IN A KNOWN RVD PATIENT R/O SECONDARIES TO THE HEAD AND NECK
Technique: Axial, Sagittal and Coronal T1WI, TIWI+Gd and T2WI; 3D-T1WI, Coronal and Sagittal STIR; Axial FLAIR and T2-FFE; DWI and ADC map at 1.5T
Findings:
There is a large exophytic solid mass lesion with a widest diameter of 98mm arising from the left orbit, with poor definition of the left bulb, optic nerve and extra-ocular muscles. This mass destroys almost the entire left orbital walls (with partial erosion of the orbital plate of the frontal bone) and further extends into the ipsilateral frontal, ethmoidal, and maxillary sinuses. 
The mass shows high signal on T2WI and FLAIR; intermediate signal on T1WI, T2-FFE and STIR; heterogeneous signal on DWI and heterogeneous contrast enhancement.
There is no intra-cranial extension.

FINDINGS: 
There is an irregular circumscribed popcorn-shaped intra-axial mass lesion measuring 40 x 31 x 23mm (volume: ) in the para-median aspect of the left cerebellar hemisphere. It is heterogeneously hyperintense on FLAIR, shows hyperintense rim and an isointense core on T1WI. This mass also shows heterogeneous signal with a rim of low signal intensity on T2WI. This mass shows heterogeneous signal on DWI with no evidence of restricted diffusion. There is minimal perilesional oedema and mass effect. 
The ventricles and basal cisterns show normal signal.
There are small round periventricular and white matter hyperintense signals in both cerebral hemispheres, consistent with microangiopathy. The cerebral hemispheres are otherwise normal.
There is no extra axial mass lesion.
The midbrain, pons and medulla show normal signal. 
The cerebral arteries and vertebrobasilar system show normal ramifications with no focal dilatation.
A separate lobulated heterogeneous mass measuring 77 x 23 x 18mm is in the sub-galeal aponeurosis of the left parietal region. This mass is predominantly isointense on T1WI and FLAIR, hypointense on T2WI and shows no evidence of restricted diffusion.

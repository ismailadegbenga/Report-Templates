# Xray

### Normal
Findings:
The lung fields are clear of opacities, nodules and masses.
There is no pleural effusion.
The heart size and mediastinum are normal
The density and architecture of the bony chest wall are normal.
Impression: Normal chest radiograph

### Hypertensive Heart Dx
Findings:
There is cardiomegaly (CTR: 0.56) with unfolding of the aorta.
The lungs are clear of opacities.
There is no evidence of pleural effusion.
The bony thorax is normal.

Impression: Cardiomegaly (secondary to Hypertensive heart disease).


# CT

## Normal

Chest CT Scan
Indication:
Technique: Plain and contrast enhanced series of chest CT
Findings: 
There is no supraclavicular, retrostenal, mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.
The lung fields are clear of opacities, nodules and masses.
There is no pleural effusion.
The heart size is within normal limits. There is no pericardial effusion.
The outline, density and architecture of the dorsal spine, ribs and sternum are normal.

Impression: Normal Chest CT Scan


## CTPA

### Normal

CT Pulmonary Angiography

Indication: ? DVT r/o PE

Technique: Standard pulmonary angiography protocol

Findings:

There is no filling defect in the main, right and left pulmonary arteries down to their segmental branches.  
The pulmonary artery-aorta ratio is normal.  
There is no evidence of right ventricular hypertension.  
The lungs are clear of opacities.  
There is no pleural effusion.  
The heart size and mediastinum are normal.  
The bony thorax is normal.

**Impression**: Normal CT pulmonary angiography

### Pulmonary hypertension and Right heart failure
Clinical indication: RT SIDED HEART FAILURE SEC TO SEVERE PULMONARY HYPERTENSION.
PROTOCOL: Contrast enhanced MDCT pulmonary angiogram was done at 2mm axial slices and reformatted images were acquired and reviewed.
FINDINGS: 	
The heart is enlarged with a CTR of 189/306.
There are patchy ground glass opacities in both upper lobes.
There is engorgement of the pulmonary vasculature.
The demonstrated upper abdomen shows an enlarged liver with dilated IVC and hepatic veins suggestive of passive hepatic congestion. There is early enhancement of the dilated IVC and hepatic veins on the arterial phase as well likely due to reflux from the right atrium into the IVC.
There is significant dilatation of the main pulmonary trunk and the pulmonary arteries (diameter: pulmonary trunk=39mm; main pulmonary artery R=20mm, L =21mm). 
The right pulmonary artery is seen crossing the carina midline anteriorly (carina cross over sign).
The ratio of the diameter of the main pulmonary trunk/ascending aorta is increased (1.56)
The segmental artery to bronchial diameter ratio is increased.
There is associated peripheral pruning of the pulmonary vessels.
The pulmonary trunk, main pulmonary arteries and their branches are well opacified with no filling defects seen within them.
The ascending aorta, arch of aorta and the descending aorta are normal. 
The bronchi are within normal limits.
Normal bronchial tapering is noted bilaterally
No mediastinal mass or hilar adenopathy is seen.
The esophagus and trachea appear normal.
No lytic/blastic bony changes. 

CONCLUSION: Features are those of:
1.	Congestive cardiac failure. 
2.	Pulmonary arterial hypertension.
3.	No evidence of pulmonary embolism is seen.
2D Echo is advised for further evaluation.

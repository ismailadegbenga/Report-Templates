## Xray
### Normal
There is normal pelvic symmetry.
There is no evidence of fracture or subluxation of the bones and joints of the pelvis.
The epiphyses and apophyses of both femora appear normal.
The hip joint spaces appear normal.

Impression: Normal pelvic radiograph

## CT PELVIMETRY
Indication:
Technique: Lateral scanogram, Low-dose axial CT slices of the pelvis with multiplanar reformation in bone window setting. 
Findings:
A single foetus in cephalic presentation is noted. The foetal head is superior to the pelvic inlet.
The dimensions of the bony pelvis are as follows:
Obstetric conjugate: 98.1mm (Normal range: 105 – 115mm)
Transverse diameter of pelvic inlet: 100mm (Normal range: 130 – 145mm)	
Sum of pelvic inlet measurements:  198mm
Anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet is: 101mm (Normal range: > 115mm)
Interspinous distance: 99mm (Normal range: 95 - 115mm)
Transverse diameter of pelvic outlet: 109mm (Normal range: 100 – 110mm)

Conclusion: Narrow pelvis
Key:
Obstetric conjugate
-	Narrow: < 105mm
-	Borderline: 105 – 114mm
-	Normal: >= 115mm
Sum of pelvic inlet measurements: (Normal range: > 240mm)
-	Narrow: < 230mm
-	Borderline: 230 – 240mm
-	Normal: > 240mm



## MRI 
### PELVIS
TECHNIQUE: Axial, Sagittal and Coronal T2WI, Axial T1WI, STIR, DWI and ADC map of the pelvis
INDICATION: ANAL CARCINOMA
FINDINGS:
There is a large irregular circumferential solid mass with a longitudinal length of 65mm involving almost the entire extent of the anal canal. It extends from about 25mm above the anal verge to just superior to the level of the anorectal junction. The epicenter of this mass is about 8mm above the dentate line. The tumour follows a spiral course lying on the anterior wall above the anorectal junction and invades the internal sphincter and intersphincteric space between the 2 o’clock and the 10 o’clock positions of the anal wall below the anorectal junction. This mass has a large intraluminal component measuring 65 x 59 x 31mm. It shows intermediate signal on T1WI, T2WI STIR with evidence of restricted diffusion. There is no breech of the external anal sphincter, Denonvillier’s fascia or invasion of levator ani.
There is a round heterogeneous lymph node with a short-axis diameter of 12mm in the left external iliac region. Three similarly suspicious right internal iliac lymph nodes with short-axis diameters of 15mm, 14mm and 11mm and two left internal iliac nodes with short-axis diameters of 19mm and 10mm are noted. There are  no lymph nodes in the ischioanal fossa. 
The uterus, vaginal wall, adnexal structures, urinary bladder and the bones of the pelvis return normal signal.
IMPRESSION: Anal carcinoma with locoregional nodal metastasis (TNM stage: T3N1bMx)

## CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LEFT UPPER LIMB
Indication:  Aneurysm of left upper limb vessel
Technique: Pre- and post-contrast 0.5mm axial slices were obtained with 3D volume rendering and MIP.   
Finding:

There is normal flow of contrast through all the arteries of the left upper limb.
The subclavian, axillary, brachial, radial, ulnar and median arteries are patent and normal. These vessels also show normal caliber and ramification. 
There is no plaque, vessel wall calcification, thrombus or aneurysm in any of the vessels
The bones of the upper limb show normal density and architecture.
There is no soft tissue swelling. 
Conclusion:  Normal CT angiogram. 


## CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER LIMBS
Indication:  
Technique: Pre- and post-contrast 0.5mm axial slices were obtained from the lower aortic bifurcation at L4 to the feet with 3D volume rendering and MIP reconstructions.   
Finding: There is normal flow of contrast through all the arteries of both lower limbs. These vessels also show normal caliber and ramification. 
There is no plaque, vessel wall calcification, thrombus or aneurysm in any of the vessels
Conclusion: Normal study. 

## CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER LIMBS
Indication:  Severe peripheral arterial disease
Technique: Pre- and post-contrast 0.5mm axial slices were obtained from the lower aortic bifurcation at L4 to the feet with 3D volume rendering and MIP reconstructions.   
Findings: 
There are widespread calcified atheromatous plaques in all the arteries of both lower limbs, bilateral common iliac artery, aortic bifurcation and distal abdominal aorta.
There are multiple haemodynamically significant stenoses in the bilateral anterior and posterior tibial arteries with the right anterior tibial artery worst affected.
There is near-total occlusion of the middle two-thirds of the right anterior tibial artery with distal reconstitution of the distal third arterial segment. 
Less severe stenoses are noted in the other arteries of both legs.
There is no thrombus, aneurysm or dissection in any of the vessels
Marked soft tissue irregularity, fat stranding and ulceration is noted in the right foot and distal third of the right leg.
Conclusion: Severe peripheral arterial disease

**CT AORTOGRAM**

**Indication**: Post angioplasty for coarctation of the aorta

**Technique**: Standard CT aortography protocol

**Pre-operative comparative imaging**: Not available

**Findings**: 

There is normal opacification of the aortic lumen from the root to its bifurcation. There is no demonstrable residual luminal narrowing. There is no evidence of dissection, aneurysm, intra-mural or para-aortic haematoma. There is no radiographic contrast extravasation, pleural effusion or ascites. There is no stenosis at the origin of the direct branches of the aorta. There is also no evidence of end-organ ischaemia.

The diameter of the aortic segments are normal as follows:

Aortic sinus: 32mm

Sino-tubular junction: 28mm

Ascending aorta: 31mm

Aortic arch: 26mm

Descending aorta: 19mm

Abdominal aorta (level of aortic hiatus): 15mm

Abdominal aorta (level of renal arteries): 9mm

Conclusion: No evidence of re-stenosis or post-procedure complication in a known case of aortic coarctation post angioplasty

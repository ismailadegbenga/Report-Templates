MULTIPARAMETRIC PROSTATE MRI
Indication: ? CAP

Technique: Multiplanar T1-weighted (T1WI), T2-weighted (T2WI), Diffusion-weighted (DWI), Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCEI) sequences of the prostate at 1.5T

Findings: 

Enlarged prostate with volume of 146 ml (70 mm x 68 mm × 59 mm × 0.52). 

Peripheral zone: shows indistinct hyperintensities on DWI without corresponding hypointensity on the ADC map (PI-RADS 2). 

Transition zone: Oval T2WI non-circumscribed hypointense nodule with a diameter of 13mm at the mid-level in the anterior half on the left. Shows moderate hypointense signal on DWI with corresponding hyperintense signal on the ADC map. It also shows early differential contrast enhancement on DCEI (PI-RADS 4). Two other circumscribed wedge-shaped nodules with diameters of 17.3 and 16.8mm are in the superior third of the right and left posterior half respectively. These lesions are moderately hyperintense on high b-value DWI  and moderately hypointense on the ADC map. Both do not show differential contrast enhancement on the DCEI (PI-RADS 3). There are also other multiple (4 - 6) circumscribed hypointense encapsulated nodules without restricted diffusion (PI-RADS 2). 

Anterior fibromuscular zone: normal

No suspicious locoregional or pelvic lymph nodes. 

No suspicious bone lesions.

Conclusion: 

- Clinically significant cancer likely (PI-RADS 4) in the left anterior transitional zone

- Clinically significant cancer equivocal (PI-RADS 3) in the bilateral posterior transitional zones

## PI-RADS 3

Clinical Notes: Known prostate cancer Gleason 6 under active surveillance diagnosed 1 year ago. PSA 5.4 ng/ml. Under α1-adrenergic receptor therapy for BPH.

Technical Details: Standard prostate MRI protocol, 3 T MRI scanner, 13 ml Multihance.

Findings: Enlarged prostate of circa 48 ml (58 mm × 38 mm × 42 mm × 0.52). Peripheral zone: On high b-value DW images and ADC map normal peripheral zone with indistinct hypointensities on the ADC map (PI-RADS 2). Transition zone: On T2w image lesion of 9 mm maximal extension (white arrow) at the mid-level in the anterior half on the right with heterogeneous, indistinct triangular, signal intensity with obscured margins with mild hypointense signal (PI-RADS 3). The lesion is showing mildly hyperintense signal on high b-value DW image (white arrowhead) and moderate signal intensity on ADC map (black arrowhead) (ADC ~850 × 10−6mm2/s) (PI-RADS 3). DCE-MRI is rated positive, showing a focal enhancement, earlier than adjacent prostate tissue (black arrow). Multiple circumscribed hypointense encapsulated nodules (BPH) (PI-RADS 2). No suspicious locoregional or pelvic lymph nodes. No suspicious bone lesions. No additional findings.

Conclusion: The presence of clinically significant prostate cancer is equivocal in the transition zone showing a lesion in the right anterior mid-level corresponding to PI-RADS 3. No suspicious lymph nodes or bone lesions.

## PI-RADS 4
Indication: ? CAP
Technique: Multiplanar T1-weighted (T1WI), T2-weighted (T2WI), Diffusion-weighted (DWI), Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCEI) sequences of the prostate
Findings:
The prostate is enlarged; it measures 56 x 63 x 51mm (L x W x AP) with a mass of 94.1gm. The median prostatic lobe is also mildly prominent, with an intra-vesical prostatic protrusion of 10.3mm.
There is an oval T2WI hypointense nodule with a diameter of 31mm at the junction of the apex and middle third of the posterolateral right peripheral zone posteriorly. This lesion is hyperintense on high b-value DWI and hypointense on ADC, consistent with restricted diffusion. There is, however, no rapid wash-in and wash-out of contrast on the DCEI.
A second T2WI hypointense nodule with a diameter of 16mm in the left posterolateral peripheral zone shows no evidence of restricted diffusion.
There is signal heterogeneity and multiple cystic areas in the posterior peripheral zone with poor definition of the pseudocapsule, suggesting previous trans-rectal prostate biopsies.
A circumscribed T2WI hypointense nodule with a diameter of 17mm is in the transitional zone on the right side; it shows no restricted diffusion.
The seminal vesicles are normal. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.
There are cysts in the right acetabulum and right ischial tuberosity.
Impression: PI-RADS 4 (Clinically significant likely)



## Post radical prostatectomy
MULTIPARAMETRIC PROSTATE MRI
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1-weighted (T1WI), T2-weighted (T2WI), Diffusion-weighted (DWI), Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging sequences of the pelvis
INDICATION: NOT PROVIDED - PATIENT HAS HOWEVER HAD PROSTACTECTOMY IN 2020
FINDINGS:
Status post radical prostatectomy with total removal of the seminal vesicles is noted.
The vesicoureteric anastomosis is homogeneously hypointense in all sequences, consistent with post-operative fibrosis. There is no mass lesion or area of abnormal T2WI signal, restricted diffusion or dynamic contrast enhancement in the perianastomotic, retrovesical or bladder neck regions. 
There are no pelvic lymph nodes.
The bones return normal signal.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of local tumour recurrence post radical prostatectomy

## PIRADS 5
Clinical Notes: Actual PSA: 27.5 ng/ml; PSA last year: 31.4 ng/ml. One year previous prostate biopsy revealed no cancer.

Technical Details:  Standard prostate MRI protocol, 3 T MRI scanner, 16 ml Multihance.

Findings: Enlarged prostate of circa 43 ml (44 mm × 51 mm × 37 mm × 0.52). Peripheral zone: Midlevel on T2w image depicts a focal lesion of 20 mm maximal extension (PI-RADS 5) (white arrows). The lesion shows a high signal intensity in the anterior fibromuscular stroma and in the left peripheral anterior zone on the high b-value DW image (white arrowheads) with corresponding low signal intensity on the ADC map (black arrowheads) (ADC ~580 × 10−6mm2/s) (PI-RADS 5). DCE-MRI is rated positive, showing a focal enhancement, earlier than adjacent prostate tissue (black arrows). Transition zone: Circumscribed hypointense encapsulated nodules (BPH) (PI-RADS 2). No suspicious locoregional or pelvic lymph nodes. No suspicious bone lesions. No additional findings.

Conclusion: Clinically significant prostate cancer is highly likely to be present in the anterior fibromuscular stroma and in the left peripheral anterior zone in the midlevel with greatest dimension ≥ 1.5 cm corresponding to PI-RADS 5. No suspicious lymph nodes or bone lesions.

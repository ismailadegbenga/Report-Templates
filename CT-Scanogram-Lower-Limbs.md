## Valgus deformity
CT SCANOGRAM OF LOWER LIMBS
INDICATION: VALGUS DEFORMITY OF RIGHT KNEE
FINDINGS:
There is valgus deformity of the right knee, with wind-swept deformity of the right tibia.
The total limb lengths are 128.7mm and 126.0mm for the right and left sides respectively.
The right and left tibiofemoral angles are 17.7o and 4.9o respectively. (Normal: 6.85o ± 1.4o)
The lateral mechanical axis deviation for the right lower limb is 7.2mm and the medial mechanical axis deviation for the left is 1.4mm.
The joint orientation angles are as follows:
Angle in degrees	Right	Left	Normal (Range)
Anatomic Medial Proximal Femoral Angle (aMPFA)	81.1	86.8	84 (80 – 89)
Mechanical Lateral Proximal Femoral Angle (mLPFA)	85.7	89.5	90 (85 – 95)
Mechanical Lateral Distal Femoral Angle (mLDFA)	85.8	90	88 (85 – 90)
Anatomic Lateral Distal Femoral Angle (aLDFA)	81.7	85.8	81 (79 – 83)
Medial Proximal Tibial Angle (MPTA)	100.5	89.1	87 (85 – 90)
Lateral Distal Tibial Angle (LDTA)	91	90.4	89 (86 – 92)

IMPRESSION: Features consistent with valgus deformity of the right knee joint.

## Blount's disease
CT SCANOGRAM OF THE LOWER LIMBS
INDICATION: Blount’s disease
FINDINGS:
There is bilateral depression of the medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphysis with severe varus deformity of both tibial shafts and knee joints.
The metaphyseal-diaphyseal angles for the right and left tibia are 55.3o and 56.6o respectively (normal: < 11o)
The right and left anatomic tibiofemoral angles are both 48o. (Normal: 6.85o ± 1.4o)
All the bilateral knee joint orientation angles are abnormal. The joint orientation angles are as stated in the table below:
Angle in degrees	Right	Left	Normal range
Anatomic Medial Proximal Femoral Angle (aMPFA)	107.4	100.1	84 (80 – 89)
Mechanical Lateral Proximal Femoral Angle (mLPFA)	71	74.2	90 (85 – 95)
Anatomic Lateral Distal Femoral Angle (aLDFA)	87.9	88.7	81 (79 – 83)
Mechanical Lateral Distal Femoral Angle (mLDFA)	92.5	93	88 (85 – 90)
Medial Proximal Tibial Angle (MPTA)	38.1	50.7	87 (85 – 90)
Lateral Distal Tibial Angle (LDTA)	89.1	87,4	89 (86 – 92)


IMPRESSION: Features consistent with congenital tibia vara.

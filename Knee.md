## Xray
### Normal
Indication: Pain

Comparison Study: Nil

Technique: AP and Lateral of both knees

Findings:

The outline, alignment, density and architecture of the bones of both knee joints are normal.
There is no fracture, subluxation or degenerative change.
The joint spaces are preserved.
There is no soft tissue swelling.

Impression: Normal knee radiograph

## MRI

### Normal
Indication: Bilateral knee pain
Technique: Sagittal T2WI, PDW-SPAIR, FFE; Coronal T1WI, PDW-SPAIR; Axial T2WI, PDW-SPAIR of left knee without IV contrast using 1.5Tesla MRI system
Findings:
There is no fracture, dislocation, joint effusion, bone contusion or haemarthrosis. The articular cartilages show normal thickness and signal. There are no abnormal signal changes in the bone marrow. There are no osteophytes.
The muscles and tendons show normal signal. The medial and lateral menisci are normal.
The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments as well as the medial and lateral collateral ligaments are preserved. 
The patellar ligament as well as medial and lateral patellar retinaculi are normal.
Conclusion: Normal study

### Normal
MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE
Indication: Left knee osteoarthritis r/o meniscus injury
Technique: Axial, Sagittal and Coronal PDW; Coronal T1WI; Axial T2WI; Sagittal FFE of the left knee at 1.5T
Findings:
The medial and lateral menisci show normal size, shape and morphology. There is no evidence of meniscal degeneration or tear. There is no sign of a discoid meniscus.
The anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, medial collateral, and lateral collateral ligaments are normal.
There is no joint effusion, synovial thickening or intraarticular loose bodies. The Hoffa's fat pad is normal.
The quadriceps tendon, patellar ligament, medial and lateral retinaculum are normal.
There is no collection in the periarticular bursae. The pes anserine tendons are normal.
The periarticular muscle fibres are normal.
The femoral, tibial and patellar articular cartilages are normal. There is no chondromalacia patellae or osteochondral defect.
There is no evidence of lytic destructive lesion, osteoarthritis, fracture, marrow edema or periosteal reaction in visualized bones.
The subcutaneous and deep fat planes are unremarkable.
Conclusion: Normal study


### Ligamentous injury
Clinical Information: RTA

Protocol: Multiplanar PD, PF fat sat, T2, T1 and T1 with contrast were acquired through the right knee and reviewed:

Findings:

Bone: The articular bones appear normal; no fractures is seen. However posterolateral tibial plateau, lateral and medial femoral condylar contusions with marrow edema are noted suggesting pivot shift injury.  There is lateral displacement of the patella with complete disruption of the medial and lateral patella retinaculum.

Marked knee joint effusion with surrounding soft tissue edema is seen, likely traumatic.

Menisci: There increased T2 signal intensity noted within the anterior and posterior horns of the medial meniscus. The lateral meniscus appears normal.

Ligaments and tendons: There is complete disruption of the tibia attachment of the ACL with retraction of its fibres and increased T2 signal intensity within its entire substance consistent with full thickness tear. There is also abnormal diffuse increased T2 signal intensity noted within the horizontal fibres of the PCL in keeping with full thickness tear. 

Note complete disruption of medial collateral ligament. Fluid signal is also seen in the lateral collateral consistent with ligamentous injury. The popliteofibular ligament appears intact.   The popliteal tendon and Iliotibial bands are also normal.

Extensor mechanism: The Hoffa’s fat pad appears edematous suggesting impingement. The quadriceps tendons are normal. The patella tendon appears normal.

CONCLUSION:   Features are those of pivot shift injury with:
1.	Full thickness ACL and PCL tear.
2.	Grade 2 Lateral and Grade 3 medial collateral ligamentous injuries.
3.	Lateral dislocation of the patella with complete tear of lateral and medial patella retinaculum.
4.	Hoffa fat pad impingement.
5.	Marked knee joint effusion.
6. 	Medial meniscal injury.

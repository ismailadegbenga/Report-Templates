## Normal

Findings:
The breast composition is {homogeneous fibroglandular | heterogeneous | homogeneous fat}.
There is no mass lesion, cyst or area of architectural distortion in either breast.
The mammary zone, retromammary space and sub-areolar regions are normal.
There is no skin thickening or nipple retraction.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.

Conclusion: Normal breast scan 
Impression: ACR BIRADS Category 1, Normal findings

## Fibroadenoma
The breast composition is {homogeneous fibroglandular | heterogeneous | homogeneous fat}.
There is a {round | oval | irregular} {anechoic | hypoechoic | hyperechoic} {solid | cystic} mass measuring { x mm} in the { } o'clock
position about { }mm from the {left | right} nipple.
This mass is {parallel | non-parallel} to the skin, has {circumscribed | lobulated | obscured} margins and has {no | speckled | coarse | fine | micro} calcifications.
There is {no} skin tethering and nipple retraction in either breast.
There is {no} axillary lymphadenopathy.

Conclusion: {Solid | Cystic} {right | left} breast mass with benign features (probably a fibroadenoma)
Impression: ACR BIRADS Category 2, 


# Mammography

## BI-RADS 0
Technique: Cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique projections of both breasts were obtained.
Findings:
The breasts are extremely dense, which reduces the sensitivity of mammography.
There are no micro or macro calcifications in either breast.
There is no architectural distortion in either breast.
There is no skin tethering or nipple retraction.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.

Conclusion: Inconclusive study
Impression: ACR BI-RADS Assessment Category 0, with a recommendation to follow up with breast ultrasound or MRI

## BI-RADS I
Technique: Cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique projections of both breasts were obtained.
Findings:
The breasts are {almost entirely fatty | of scattered fibroglandular density | heterogeneously dense | extremely dense} composition.
There are no {micro or macro} calcifications in either breast.
There is no mass lesion, asymmetry or architectural distortion in either breast.
There is no skin tethering or nipple retraction.
There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.

Conclusion: Normal study
Impression: ACR BIRADS Assessment Category I, with a recommendation to continue annual screening mammography

## BI-RADS II

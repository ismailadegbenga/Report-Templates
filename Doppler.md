The deep veins of both lower limbs are compressible on B-mode sonography.
The blood flow in these veins show normal respiratory periodicity and cardiac phasicity on spectral Doppler imaging.

The sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions are bilaterally patent and competent.
The groins are free of lymphadenopathy.
There is no soft tissue swelling of the lower limbs.

Impression: Normal Doppler screen with no evidence of deep vein thrombosis

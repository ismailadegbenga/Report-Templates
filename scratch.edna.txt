# Programmability

If current block is Go or JavaScript block, you can run it:

-   `Alt + Shift + R` keyboard shortcut
-   context menu: `Run / Run <javascript> block`
-   command palette: `Block: Run <language> block`

The output of execution will be shown in a new block created below the executed block.

You can run JavaScript functions with the content of a current block or a selection.

The function gets the content as argument, can traform it, and we show the output in a block below.

For example a function can sort the lines in a block, calculate md5 hash or transform it to upper case. The possibilities are literally limitless.

To run a JavasScript function with content of block:

-   context menu: `Run` / `Run function with block content`
-   command palette: `Run function with block content`
-   pick a function from the list

To run a JavasScript function with selection:

-   context menu: `Run` / `Run function with selection`
-   command palette: `Run function with selection`
-   pick a function from the list

If you want to see all built-in functions use:

-   context menu: `Run`, `Show built-in functions`
-   command palette: `Shw built-in functions`
